title: "Xpenses: Personal Expenditure Manager and Group Bill Splitter"
collection: projects 
permalink: /projects/2018-07-18-xpenses
description: Collaborated on a cross-platform (web, mobile and desktop) application for managing and analyzing group as well as personal day-to-day expenses. We did this at a time when a similar application (Splitwise) used to do the same as an Android app but they didn't yet possess a competitive version for both web and desktop.<br> Administered databases for a concurrent, synchronized back-end, further intregating it to an easy-on-the-eye design for Web (HTML/CSS/Javascript), Desktop (JAVA) and Android UI/UX with multi-user access support, easing the settling of group expenses, and categorizing/monitoring of personal ones.
