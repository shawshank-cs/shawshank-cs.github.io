collection: projects 
permalink: /projects/2020-02-26-interactive-cookbook
description: A recipe parser configured to recognize various ingredients, tools and cooking methods used in a given recipe from recipe URLs provided from www.allrecipes.com. We developed a framework to ensure seamless transformations on the recipe along multiple utilitarian dimensions like to and from vegan, scaling the amount to half or double, changing to a favorite style of cuisine, making it healthier, etc. by using our systemâ€™s internal representation for ingredients, cooking methods, and tools.
